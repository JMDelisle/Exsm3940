EXSM 3940 Final Project
Due: June 12/22 @ 11:59pm

This is the final project of 3940, where we take the user name and phone number to store it. Once stored we are to output it into a data table form.

Bugs:
 - Issue I am having now is for some reason it wants me to use middleware and thunk. I don't know what this is and now trying to find an alternative codes to assist me.
 - Had installed thunk and everything is working and seem line 4 and 12 in userActions seems to be declaring it thunk based?!?! 
 - Everything is working but now for some reason the Component that is suppose to be displayed isn't getting displayed. Console.log() shows it is retrieving the input. Not sure if thunk is having an issue or what!?!?
 - Put in redux store into tables. 
 - Still having issue where "UserList" won't display.
